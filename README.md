## Setup

To install requirements:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate aleatoric-epistemic-uncertainty-rl
conda env list

python setup.py develop
```
After the setup, it is possible to run the different models in the paper and reproduce the results by using the files `src/policies/dqn/run*.py`. The input parameters of the methods are self-explanatory.
